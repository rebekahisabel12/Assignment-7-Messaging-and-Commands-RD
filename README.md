# Assignment-7

# Working off Assignment-6, looking to implement internal and external message bussing and pass a few of my tests. If its not obvious an_organ is my api folder similar to the barkyapi folder. I went with Django signals here but still have the tasks.py file importing Celery. Still continued to follow the barky code.

# Because of the way I want to run my permissions and views I was struggling making the tests pass correctly. Learning why making the test firsts is crucial instead of making the code first. I'm testing the Instrument class mostly because I wrote the code in a way that the AnalyticalMethod class needs a field from the Instrument class, so in a progression with more time I will test the AnalyticalMethod class as well as complete the tests for the Instrument class.
