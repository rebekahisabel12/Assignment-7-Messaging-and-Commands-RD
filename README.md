# Assignment-7

# Working off assignment-6, looking to implement internal and external message bussing and pass a few of my tests. If its not obvious an_organ is my api folder similar to the barkyapi folder. I went with Django signals here and still continued to follow the barky code.

# Because of the way I want to run my permissions and views I have to make the test correctly. Learning why making the test firsts is crucial instead of making the code first.
